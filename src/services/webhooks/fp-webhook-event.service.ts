/**
 * Shared plumbing every WHK-1..WHK-6 handler sits on.
 *
 * FP sends unsigned JSON - the header dump on a real delivery carried no signature, no HMAC and
 * no auth header, and /v2/notification_webhooks has no secret parameter to sign with. So the
 * inbound payload is treated as an untrusted *hint*: it tells us which object changed, and we
 * re-fetch that object from FP over our own authenticated client before persisting anything.
 * A forged POST then costs an attacker one wasted API call instead of a corrupted plan row.
 *
 * That costs nothing extra in practice - the handlers have to hand an FP object to
 * `upsert_from_fp` regardless, so this only changes where the object comes from.
